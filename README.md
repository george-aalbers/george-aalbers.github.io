# About me
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hi, my name is George Aalbers, PhD, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Psychiatry, AmsterdamUMC, where I work for the Stress-in-Action consortium. I have a multidisciplinary background (psychology, communication science, and artificial intelligence; see my dissertation [here](https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/76419383/Aalbers_Digital_04-07-2023.pdf)). I use machine learning and digital phenotyping data to recognize and forecast depression and anxiety disorders. I co-supervise two PhD students: Marcos Ross and Noa van Zwieten.

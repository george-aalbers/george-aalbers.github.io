# About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher for the Stress-in-Action consortium and I am stationed at the Department of Psychiatry, AmsterdamUMC. My current work focuses on using digital phenotyping data to recognize and forecast depression and anxiety disorders. Analytically, I lean towards a machine learning approach for which I use Python. I co-supervise two PhD students: Marcos Ross and Noa van Zwieten.

# About me
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hi, my name is George Aalbers and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Psychiatry, AmsterdamUMC, where I work for the Stress-in-Action consortium. In my research, I use machine learning and digital phenotyping data for depression and anxiety prediction. I currently co-supervise two PhD students: Marcos Ross and Noa van Zwieten.

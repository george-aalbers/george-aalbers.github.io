# About me
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Psychiatry, AmsterdamUMC, where I work for the Stress-in-Action consortium. My current work focuses on using digital phenotyping data to recognize and forecast depression and anxiety disorders. I co-supervise two PhD students: Marcos Ross and Noa van Zwieten.
